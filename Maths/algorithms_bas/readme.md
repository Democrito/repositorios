In this folder I am adding mathematical algorithms in FreeBasic language that in one way or another can serve to inspire calculations with FPGA.
It is intended, though not always the case, that these algorithms only use additions and displacements and sometimes tables.
Many of them have already been applied in projects for [**Icestudio**](https://github.com/FPGAwars/icestudio).

If you want to compile these programs, follow these instructions: https://sites.google.com/site/proyectosroboticos/instalacion-fbide
