# Square root in Q8.8 format

The "sqrt_Q8_8.ice" module will allow you to make square roots in Q8.8 format (fixed point).

I recommend looking at the example first to see the operation and deduce the operation of the main module. "Example_serial_sqrt_fix_point_q8_8.ice" is an example of how to use such a module. In the input, the decimal part, I always put 0 to keep this example simple. You type a number and when you hit enter the result will appear. It does not allow using negative numbers, of course, this is only possible with imaginary numbers.
