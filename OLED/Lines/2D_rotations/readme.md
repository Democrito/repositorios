Examples of rotation of lines and figures. The SPI and I2C folders contain the same examples, only the protocol changes.

Here are some demo videos of the circuits included here:

1.) ![Example_Spinning Wheel](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pZOFqYocVHE)
2.) ![Example_Spinning_Square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k746fesv4bM)
3.) ![Example_Spinning_Triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU39G4tLVxM)
4.) ![Example_Two_Needles](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/46PbbhHPH-E)

The circuits that are here are improved, the videos belong to the first tests I did.
