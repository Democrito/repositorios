The "**Speedometer_I2C.ice**" and "**Voltmeter_I2C.ice**" files are identical, only the wallpaper changes. As their names indicate, each one is fixed in that role. The ADC that comes in the Alhambras II FPGA is used to simulate speed or voltage. These examples are designed to be functional from the file itself and also to be used as a module, it has an icon included.

If your FPGA is not an Alhambra II, you can use the "**No_ADC_needle_indicator_I2C.ice**" example where you will see a needle move from start to finish and then back again, like this indefinitely. Inside this circuit there are two wallpapers, try both.

All wallpapers were made by [**@joaquim**](https://github.com/jojo535275). Thank you very much!
