On this page there is a file named "Universal_OLED_SH_and_SSD_Lines.ice". It has one more input pin, called "choose".

This pin allows us to choose what type of screen we want to use. If we put a '1' on that pin, we will be telling it that we are going to use a SH1106 screen; and if we put a '0' on that same pin, we are telling it that we are going to use an SSD130x screen.
