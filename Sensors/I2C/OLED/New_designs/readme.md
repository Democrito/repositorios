# Draw multiple lines with a wallpaper.

### New design for drawing lines with a wallpaper for 128x64 monochrome OLED SSDs & SH1106

The two folders (SSD and SH1106) contain the modules and examples of a driver that will allow you to paint lines with a wallpaper. Both folders contain the same examples, the only difference being the driver chip type.
SH1106 displays differ from SSDs in that they have a 132x64 resolution; however, here we run them at the same resolution as the SSD displays (128x64 pixels).

I highly recommend using these new improved modules. They are very easy to implement in any design and it is much more powerful.

The image represents the controller module for an SSD, however the pinout is exactly the same as for the SH1106 displays.

**1.) To draw a line, we put the coordinate data (x0,y0), (x1,y1) and give it a tick on the "startln" pin and wait for a tick on the "nextln" pin . If you want to draw more lines, repeat the same thing again.**  

**2.) When you want to see the drawing on the screen, give the "print" pin a tick. Wait for a "done" tick to return to point 1.)**
