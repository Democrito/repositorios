### In this section I include I2C sensors and peripherals.

*If you find a module that doesn't work, please let me know, it would mean there are in some modules inputs pins in the air inside the design. As of toolchain version 8.0, those inputs are not considered logical 0 and now they are antennas (noise source).*

To know how write-only and read/write I2C modules work, see here: https://github.com/Democrito/repositorios/tree/master/I2C
