## x1 and x4 incremental encoder readers

The x1 encoder reader can be used for mechanical encoders (potentiometer type, although it's not a potentiometer), optical encoders, and magnetic encoders. It doesn't have a debouncer, but it works very well.  

I recommend the x4 encoder reader only for optical and magnetic encoders.
