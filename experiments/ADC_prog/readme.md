This is a programmable version for the ADC that comes in the Alhambras (ADS7924). Inside it contains a small microcontroller that is specially designed for I2C control. The file with extension **.list** contains the machine code program for the ADC. Download the **.ICE** and the **.list** and have both files in the same folder before uploading the design.

As it is a simple example, I have set to read only two channels of the 4 that it has, but in reality it could read 256 channels if it had them.
