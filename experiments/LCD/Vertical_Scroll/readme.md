This is an example of vertical scrolling on a 16x2 [LCD and through I2C](https://github.com/Democrito/repositorios/tree/master/Sensors/I2C/LCD). It's not officially released because it's gliches (although it's functional) and I'll keep it here because there are modules I could use in the future. Inside there is a timer with 500ms, that timer prevents but does not completely eliminate the fault.
